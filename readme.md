# Model Training and Testing Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`model-trainig-testing.ipynb`) that demonstrates a complete pipeline for training and testing a machine learning model. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure the following are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `model-trainig-testing.ipynb`.

4. **Adjust the dataset path** in the notebook if your dataset file is not in the same directory.

   ### üìå Modify the file path:

   Locate the line where the dataset is loaded, for example:

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv")
   ```

   Update `"path/to/your/dataset.csv"` to reflect the correct path to your dataset file.

5. Run the notebook cells sequentially using **Shift + Enter** or from the menu: **Cell > Run All**.

## üß† Understanding the Notebook

### 1. **Data Loading**

* Loads a dataset (CSV format) using pandas.
* Displays the dataset‚Äôs first few rows and basic info.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

* Missing values handled.
* Features may be normalized or encoded.
* Dataset is split into training and test sets.

### 3. **Model Training**

* A machine learning model is trained using training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).

### 4. **Evaluation**

* Predictions are made on the test set (`X_test`).
* Evaluation metrics are calculated: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

### 5. **Visualization**

* Confusion matrix and performance metrics plotted using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.

---

## üìä Interpreting Results

* **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness.
* **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
* **Recall**: Coverage of actual positives.
* **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Visual layout of classification performance.

---

## üìÅ Output

* Printed classification metrics.
* Confusion matrix and other plots.
* Optionally, saved model or CSV with predictions (if implemented in the notebook).
